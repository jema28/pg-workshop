## Getting started

1.  Clone this repo and `npm i`.
1.  Run `npm run dev`in your terminal and see the result at http://localhost:5000. This is the starting template for what you'll be building.
1.  In `src/handlers.js` you'll find a function that deals with calls to the `/users` endpoint. The data is currently coming from the `static.js` file.

### Task 1: Setting up the database

We want to replace the data in `static.js` with an actual database, which we'll set up now!

1.  Connect to postgres: `psql` or `pgcli`.
1.  Create the database: `CREATE DATABASE [the name of the database];`. Note, if we were storing sensitive information you need to change your password. For now, we'll leave it as default 'password'.
1.  Add a `config.env` file and add the database's url in this format: `DB_URL = postgres://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]`. The database name needs to be in lower case.

### Task 2: Getting data from the database

1.  Connect to your database using `psql postgres://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]`.
1.  Create a table called 'users' with three columns: 'id', 'name' and 'location' and add a couple of rows of dummy data. **Hint: don't hard code the ids**
1.  Inside `queries/getData.js`, write a SQL query that pulls the user and location from your database.
1.  Change the `/users` handler in `handlers.js` to call the `getData` query.

### Task 3: Adding data to the database

In the commented out form in `index.html` we have this attribute: `action="create-user"`. When a user clicks 'submit' on this form, the details they have entered will be sent in the body to a 'create-user' endpoint.

1.  Open up `index.html` and uncomment the form
1.  Add a new endpoint to `router.js` (`/create-user`)
1.  Create a handler for the endpoint `create-user` in `handlers.js` that uses the data from your form to insert a new row into your users table.
